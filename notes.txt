Started by doing generic express framework set-up
(see my first-express-app folder)

CREATING A .gitignore FILE:
This setup will create parameter by which some files will not
be saved to GitHub. See the file name ".gitignore".

WILDCARD ROUTE
this is made to deliver 404 error to user when needed.  
It is important that this route is at the end of all other routes


code snippet for part 6.3
function show(data) {
    return (
        <Def>
            <main>
                <h1>{ data.place.name }</h1>
                <img src={data.place.pic} alt={data.place.name} />
                <div>
                    <h4>Rating</h4>
                    <p>No Ratings</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Comments</h4>
                    <p>No Comments</p>
                </div>
            </main>
        </Def>
    )
}
